## Wrapping a C++ library with JNI

- [Introduction](https://thebreakfastpost.com/2012/01/21/wrapping-a-c-library-with-jni-introduction/) outlining the general steps from starting with a C++ library to being able to build and run simple tests on some JNI wrappers;

- [Part 1](https://thebreakfastpost.com/2012/01/23/wrapping-a-c-library-with-jni-part-1/) in which I design some simple Java classes and generate the stub wrapper code;

- [Part 2](https://thebreakfastpost.com/2012/01/26/wrapping-a-c-library-with-jni-part-2/) in which I add just enough of the implementation to be able to do a test build;

- [Part 3](https://thebreakfastpost.com/2012/02/09/wrapping-a-c-library-with-jni-part-3/) discussing object lifecycles in C++ and Java;

- [Part 4](https://thebreakfastpost.com/2012/03/06/wrapping-a-c-library-with-jni-part-4/) the final episode covering a few remaining points of interest.
